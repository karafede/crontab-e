Attached follows the list of sites that present the latest 24h outliers to the Volatile (V10 and V2.5) AURN national z_score analysis.

A Z_score of +/-3 is 3 standard deviation from the mean or 99.5 percent confidence in the result. Any outlier to this value could be used as a screening tool for identifying possible instrumental issues of a site measuring Particle matter.
